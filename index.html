    <section class=about>
        Nice to meet you, I'm Sarah.
        I'm a design focused software engineer with ambitions of bringing people together through technology.

        I'm a soon to be bootcamp graduate from WeCanCodeIT based in Columbus, focused on full stack development.  I have experience developing anything from databases to websites, and the web applications that sit in between them.  
        I am constantly trying to learn more, and I don't look at graduation or employment as a finish line for improvement.  I'm always looking for people who are willing to share as I tend to be inquisitive.  My goal is to create experiences for users that are lightweight and responsive, while not sacrificing aesthetics or accessibility, with a team that is collaborating with each other to grow together.
        When I'm not working, I'm helping to manage various communities for at risk trans youth, or trying to teach myself how to cook something amazing.

        What I do:
            Web Development :
                HTML, CSS, JS that are beautiful and responsive while also being maintainable and clean.
            UX Design :
                Having faced the wall that can be getting into tech many times, I've felt the frustration of something that should be easy ends up being the opposite of that.  I strive to be mindful about this in my designs
            Diversity :
                I am a strong advocate for diversity in tech, and so is the bootcamp that I'm coming from.  As a soon to be graduate of WeCanCodeIT, I carry forward the program's mission to promoting for a more diverse field in technology

        This isn't required for this project but it's easy to slot in so I'll leave this as a comment
